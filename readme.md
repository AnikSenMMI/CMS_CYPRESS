#CMS_WITH_CYPRESS

##installation
To install cypress make sure your machine has node js.
Create project folder using '''npm init'''

install cypress with npm install 
```cypress --save-dev
Opening Cypress
If you used npm to install, Cypress has now been installed to your ./node_modules directory, with its binary executable accessible from ./node_modules/.bin.

Now you can open Cypress from your project root one of the following ways:

The long way with the full path

./node_modules/.bin/cypress open
Or with the shortcut using npm bin

$(npm bin)/cypress open
```

I have used some customize plugins please install them:
``npm install cypress-real-events``
npm i cypress-xpath
or
``npm install -D cypress-xpath``
